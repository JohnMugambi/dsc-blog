# Why-Use-Django

Building a simple Blog Application with Django is an excellent first step to get a good grasp over
the framework.
Django helps developers by speeding up the development process. It includes its own Object Relation Mapping (ORM) layer for handling database access, sessions, routing, and multi-language support. It also takes care of security while handling requests. It includes an admin panel (called django-admin) for managing models data by default.
Django also includes prevention of common attacks like Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and SQL Injections
